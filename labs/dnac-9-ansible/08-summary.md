# Summary

We have been able to add devices to Cisco DNA Center via REST API utilizing Ansible. This is the first step towards Infrastructure as Code. Utilizing an Orchestrator is key in aligning the various network controllers automating the infrastructure.

Should we wish to then start down the path of CICD, we might align files within a Git Repo, with CICD testing the changes prior to provisioning them via Ansible. 

As you might imagine one thing leads to the next and the story begins with REST API. I hope you have found the lab informative and useful.
