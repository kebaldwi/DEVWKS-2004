# Ansible Collection Dependencies

Cisco DNA Center can augment a companies Ansible automation and orchestration strategy. 

The [**cisco.dnac**](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/cisco/dnac/index.html) Ansible collection can be utilized by development engineers to build robust playbooks for Ansible that interact with Cisco DNA Center. 

> **Documentation**: For Installation Instructions and Caveats visit: [**Ansible Galaxy**](https://galaxy.ansible.com/cisco/dnac). 

The Cisco DNA Center Ansible collection depends on the [**Cisco DNA Center Python SDK**](https://dnacentersdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the version of the SDK must align with the version of Cisco DNA Center that is in use.

The latest compatibility information is available in the [**SDK Github Repository**](https://github.com/cisco-en-programmability/dnacentersdk) or [**Ansible Galaxy**](https://galaxy.ansible.com/cisco/dnac) Documentation. 

## Ansible

First lets make sure Ansible is at the required version:

```
ansible --version
```

This should show Ansible at version `2.13.10` if not use the following command to update it now:

```SHELL
sudo pip install 'ansible==6.6.0'
```

You should see something like this:
