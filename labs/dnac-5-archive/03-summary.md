# Summary

Congratulations, in this lablet, we used *Postman* to download an archive of the `running` and `startup` configurations of devices from Cisco DNA Center. 

Cisco DNA Center allows for the `archiving` of both the `running` and `startup` Configurations for devices within the inventory of Cisco DNA Center. 

In the earlier Cisco DNA Center GUI's, there was no capability to archive the configurations apart from this REST-API-based approach. Additional capabilities have been added to the most recent version of Cisco DNA Center, but there remain good use cases for this capability.

> **Note**: Additionally, if there is time, look at the pre and post-scripts within Postman.
