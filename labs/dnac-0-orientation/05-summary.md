# Summary

You have set up the Postman client with a collection, the environment, and the settings to complete the Lab. In the following sections, you use environment variables within each collection in conjunction with a data file to perform tasks on Cisco DNA Center.

We have performed a few operations in the client, and you have seen the Collections where the REST APIs are configured and the Environment where the data is stored in variables within the database.

> **Note**: Before you continue, you may take additional time to familiarize yourself with Postman.
