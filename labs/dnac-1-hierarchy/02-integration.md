# ISE Integration

In this lab, our focus changes slightly as we start to automate host onboarding. A large component of host onboarding is the authentication of hosts and assignments within the network. 

In this section, and in preparation for the steps which follow, we will integrate Cisco DNA Center with Identity Services Engine. This integration allows pxGrid communication between the Cisco DNA Center and ISE. For this reason, the **PxGrid** **persona** does need to be enabled on at least 1 ISE Node within an ISE Cluster. This has already been completed in the sandbox. 

PxGrid integration allows configuration automation by Cisco DNA Center within ISE for Network Access Devices, SGT creation, and SGACL builds via Contracts and Policy.

## Step 1: Prepare ISE for Cisco DNA Center Integration

1. Open a web browser connection to Identity Services Engine (ISE) and select the hamburger menu to open the system menu.

2. From the system menu under Administration, select PxGrid Settings

3. On the PxGrid Settings page, select both options and click Save to allow Cisco DNA Center to integrate.

## Step 2: Cisco DNA Center and ISE Integration

1. Open a web browser connection to Cisco DNA Center, select the hamburger menu, and navigate to the System > Settings menu item.

2. Within the System Settings page, navigate down the list on the left and select the Authentication and Policy Server section.

3. On the page, select from the dropdown ISE to configure ISE integration.

4. Enter the information as seen on the page and click save.

   ![json](./images/dnac-system-settings-aaa-ise-config.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

5. A popup will appear as the ISE node uses an untrusted SelfSigned Certificate. For lab purposes, accept the certificate; this may appear a couple of times, as shown.

   ![json](./images/dnac-system-settings-aaa-ise-trust.png?raw=true "Import JSON")

6. You will see the various stages of integration proceed and, finally, a success message as shown below.

   ![json](./images/dnac-system-settings-aaa-ise-done.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
   ![json](./images/dnac-system-settings-aaa-ise-complete.png?raw=true "Import JSON")
