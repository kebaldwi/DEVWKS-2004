## Summary

We have been able to deploy a template within a project inside Cisco DNA Centers template editor. 

This scenario may be augmented and modified to use imported files within Postman to allow for a more dynamic approach. The flow allows us to rapidly stage Projects and Templates, perhaps importing them from GitHub in the CICD pipeline. 

> **Note**: If there is time, look at the pre and post-scripts within Postman and look at the additionally included Deploy Template API and perhaps run it.
