# Summary

We have been able to run diagnostic commands via Rest-API, which is useful if we want to get any show command or output from any diagnostic command to a third-party system. This allows us to augment Cisco DNA Center and create whatever we like regarding troubleshooting support for other platforms like ServiceNow or other 3rd party Rest-API-based ITSM tools. 

> **Note**: Additionally, if there is time, look at the pre and post-scripts within Postman.
