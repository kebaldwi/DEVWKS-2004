# Python Applications 

In this module, we will use *Python* to interogate Cisco DNA Center and using the power or REST API we will display various settings and pull all the various templates from the platform. This lab is designed to show how you can use Cisco DNA Centers API's within Python outside of the Python SDK Library for Cisco DNA Center.

## Python Background

To help DevOps engineers, Cisco has created a rich collection of libraries to accelerate the development of API-based workflows and integrations. Currently, Cisco DNA Center supports a northbound Python Software Development Kit (SDK), RedHat and Community certified Ansible modules, a Go SDK and a Terraform provider. All these libraries are very easy to install and update, requiring only few commands. They allow the DevOps engineers to focus on rendering the data to and from the API rather than writing functions for each API call, eliminating development cycles.

Python is a very powerful tool, and can be leveraged without the Python Software Development Kit (SDK). ServiceNow, has within its APP store a Python APP, which can be utilized in addition to the Cisco DNA Center APP. Likewise other Orchestrators also make use of Python for various tasks. Python has become a very important tool for automation and orchestration within the networking community.

Within this section you will use and review prewritten code to see how various tasks can be automated.
